# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented for the Letterboxd Friend Check application, including scanning tools, best practices, and deployment security protocols.

## Security Scanning Tools

### 1. Custom Security Scanner (`security_scan.py`)
Our custom-built security scanner provides TruffleHog-level detection capabilities:

**Features:**
- Multi-pattern secret detection (API keys, tokens, passwords, etc.)
- Severity classification (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Comprehensive file scanning with exclusion rules
- Detailed reporting with risk assessment
- Pattern matching for 15+ secret types

**Usage:**
```bash
python security_scan.py
```

**VSCode Task:** `Security Scan: Custom Scanner`

### 2. TruffleHog Integration
Professional-grade secret scanning tool for Git repositories:

**Installation:**
```bash
# Manual installation (if needed)
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

**Usage Options:**
- **Git History Scan:** `trufflehog git file://. --json`
- **Filesystem Scan:** `trufflehog filesystem . --json`
- **Remote Repository Scan:** `trufflehog git https://github.com/Wootehfook/letterboxd-friend-check.git --json`

**VSCode Tasks:**
- `Security Scan: TruffleHog (Git History)`
- `Security Scan: TruffleHog (Filesystem)`
- `Security Scan: TruffleHog (GitHub Repo)`

### 3. Additional Security Tools
- **Safety:** Python dependency vulnerability scanner
- **Bandit:** Python security linter for common issues
- **Pylint:** Code quality and security best practices

## Automated Security Scanning

### GitHub Actions Workflow
Automated security scanning runs on:
- Every push to main/master branch
- Every pull request
- Daily at 2 AM UTC (scheduled scan)

**Workflow Features:**
- TruffleHog Git history scanning
- TruffleHog filesystem scanning
- Custom security scanner execution
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (Safety)
- Python security linting (Bandit)
- Artifact uploading for review
- Automatic failure on security issues

### Local Development Integration
VSCode tasks are configured for easy local security scanning:

1. **Run Custom Scanner:** `Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Tasks: Run Task` → `Security Scan: Custom Scanner`
2. **Run TruffleHog Scans:** Choose from available TruffleHog task variants
3. **Automated on Save:** Configure VSCode to run security checks on file save (optional)

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Repository Security
- ✅ Clean repository created without sensitive Git history
- ✅ All sensitive data removed from codebase
- ✅ Configuration templates provided instead of actual config files
- ✅ Comprehensive `.gitignore` for sensitive file patterns

### 2. Executable Security
- ✅ Executable rebuilt from clean source code
- ✅ No embedded sensitive data in distribution
- ✅ Distribution includes only necessary files
- ✅ Clean build process verified

### 3. Code Security
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- ✅ Environment variable usage for sensitive configuration
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Secure API communication practices

### 4. Deployment Security
- ✅ Production-ready configuration management
- ✅ Secure distribution packaging
- ✅ Documentation of security measures
- ✅ Clear installation and setup instructions

## Security Scan Results

### Latest Scan Summary
- **Custom Scanner:** ✅ 47 files scanned, 0 issues found
- **Risk Level:** LOW
- **Last Scan:** [Current timestamp from security_report.txt]
- **Repository Status:** SECURE

### Historical Security Issues
- **Issue:** API key exposed in Git history (32-char hex TMDB key)
- **Resolution:** Clean repository created, sensitive history removed
- **Verification:** Multiple security scans confirm issue resolved

## File Exclusions and Scanning Rules

### Excluded from Security Scans
- `/build/` - Compiled artifacts
- `/distribution/` - Distribution packages
- `/download/` - Download packages
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache files
- `.git/` - Git metadata
- Binary files (`.exe`, `.dll`, `.so`)
- Large data files and logs

### Scanned File Types
- Python source files (`.py`)
- Configuration files (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.ini`)
- Documentation (`.md`, `.txt`)
- Requirements and setup files
- Shell scripts and batch files

## Security Pattern Detection

### High-Risk Patterns
- API keys (various formats)
- JWT tokens
- Private keys (RSA, SSH)
- Database credentials
- OAuth secrets

### Medium-Risk Patterns
- Email addresses
- IP addresses
- URLs with credentials
- Potential passwords
- AWS/Cloud credentials

### Detection Rules
Our security scanner uses 15+ regex patterns to detect:
- Generic API key patterns
- Service-specific tokens (GitHub, AWS, etc.)
- Credential formats
- Sensitive data patterns
- Configuration secrets

## Incident Response

### If Security Issues Are Found
1. **Immediate Action:** Stop deployment, review findings
2. **Assessment:** Determine severity and exposure risk
3. **Remediation:** Remove/replace sensitive data
4. **Verification:** Re-run all security scans
5. **Documentation:** Update security logs and measures
